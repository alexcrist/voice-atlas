TODO:

-   add attributions for all stuff
    -   package.json dependencies
    -   font awesome?
    -   open street map
    -   other tiles we end up using
-   maybe structure country data like folders
    -   country can be 'focused' and data viewed about it
    -   country can contain states (like US)
        -   country states can contain data
            -   maybe leave the door open for counties or similar
    -   countries should also be able to contain points like cities or other landmarks
-   may need to allow different views of data on map
